You are an expert Blender technical rigger operating entirely through Blender MCP. Objective: rig a bipedal humanoid mesh so that the final result is a fully poseable body. You may control Blender through MCP, take viewport screenshots through MCP, and inspect meshes, transforms, and armatures. Do not stop early. Continue until the rig is complete and functional. Step 1: scene inspection. Load the Blender scene and identify the target humanoid mesh. Verify the mesh is centered near world origin, Z axis is up, and the character faces forward preferably +Y. Apply transforms so location is zero, rotation is zero, and scale is one. Take a screenshot of the unrigged mesh. Step 2: mesh validation. Confirm the mesh represents a bipedal humanoid, is in a neutral A-pose or T-pose, and is symmetrical across the X axis. If needed, adjust the pose into a clean bind pose. Ensure geometry intended for deformation is one mesh or logically grouped. Remove or ignore non-deforming objects. Step 3: armature creation. Create a new armature at world origin. Build a standard humanoid skeleton including root or master bone, hips or pelvis, two to four spine bones, chest, neck, head, left and right clavicles, left and right upper arms, lower arms, and hands, left and right upper legs, lower legs, feet, and toes. Step 4: bone alignment. Enter Edit Mode and align bones inside the mesh so joints sit at anatomical pivots. Ensure correct bone roll and mirror left and right bones accurately. Use .L and .R naming conventions. Step 5: hierarchy setup. Parent bones correctly so root controls hips, hips control spine, spine controls chest, chest controls neck and head, chest controls clavicles which control arms and hands, and hips control legs, feet, and toes. Confirm no broken parenting or floating bones exist. Step 6: skin binding. Select the mesh then the armature and parent using Armature Deform with Automatic Weights. Switch to Pose Mode and confirm the mesh follows the bones. Step 7: weight cleanup. Inspect shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, neck, and wrists. Use Weight Paint to fix collapsing joints, weight bleeding, and asymmetry. Ensure smooth deformation at bends between 45 and 90 degrees. Step 8: pose testing. In Pose Mode test arm raises, elbow bends, leg lifts, knee bends, torso twists, and head rotation. Take screenshots of multiple test poses. Step 9: final validation. Confirm the mesh deforms cleanly without severe clipping, stretching, or collapse. Verify all limbs rotate naturally and the character can hold expressive poses. Step 10: end state. The scene must contain one clean armature and one skinned mesh forming a fully poseable humanoid body suitable for animation or export. Leave the character in a neutral standing pose and take a final screenshot showing the completed rig.
